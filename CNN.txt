CNN is Convolutional Neural Network.

If there is a colourful image,the image includes three elements:R,G,B--(Red,Green,Blue).
This three channels can be the depth of an image.
So the size of the image is 256*256*3. For every pixel, it has RGB three channels.

We should compress the size of an image.How?
We compress the length and width of the image and increase the depth of image. Layer by layer...

Finally,it can generate a classify by the data of the depth.
For example,for a 0 to 9 number list,we can get [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] for number 3.

Patch or kernel/stride
Patch is a part that we pull away from the image. The patch has its own size of length and depth.
By the above operation, every patch will become a size of 1*1*k array.

Stride is the step of pulling away across the pixel. If stride==1,we pull away aross 1 pixel.

This method of pulling away data is called padding(Valid padding/ Same padding)

Pooling:a method to reduce the range of the CNN feature map.
Pooling size,pooling stride.
